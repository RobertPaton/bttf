protect her. She liked thinking back to the "old days", often telling the story of how she met and fell in love with George.</p>

                    bullying George McFly to do his homework for him. Biff often took plesure in calling George McFly an "Irish bug". He was feared by most of his schoolmates. In 1955, he surrounded himself with a gang consisting of (Match, Skinhead, and 3-D). He also had a crush on
                    Lorraine Baines and referred to her as "my girl", and continued to take an interest in her even 30 and 60 years later. Lorraine did not return the sentiments.
